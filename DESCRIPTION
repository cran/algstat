Description: algstat is a package for algebraic statistics in R.  Current
    applications include exact inference in log-linear models for contingency
    table data, analysis of ranked and partially ranked data, and general
    purpose tools for multivariate polynomials, building on the mpoly package.
    To aid in the process, algstat has ports to Macaulay2, Bertini,
    Latte-Integrale and 4ti2.
