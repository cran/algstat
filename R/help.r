#' algstat : Algebraic statistics in R
#'
#' algstat is a package for algebraic statistics in R.  Current applications include exact inference in log-linear models for contingency table data, analysis of ranked and partially ranked data, and general purpose tools for multivariate polynomials, building on the mpoly package.  To aid in the process, algstat has ports to Macaulay2, Bertini, Latte-Integrale and 4ti2.
